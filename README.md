Traffic Spy

This is a project for Turing school dealing with Ruby, Sinatra and ActiveRecord. Completed 2/2015

----

Abstract: 

In this project I used Ruby, Sinatra, and ActiveRecord to build a web traffic tracking and analysis tool.

My application will recieve data over HTTP from a simulation engine. The simulator will construct and transmit HTTP requests which include tracking data.

Imagine that you run a commercial website and embed JavaScript code which gets activated each time a page is viewed on your site. 
That JavaScript captures information about the visitor and the page theyâ€™re viewing then, in the background, submits that data to my TrafficSpy application. Myapplication parses and stores that data.
Later, you visit your site and can view data about my traffic through a HTML interface.
